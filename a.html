      <h1>Nature</h1>
      <p>Nature is the beautiful creation of the Earth that surrounds us with life, color, and calmness. It includes trees, rivers, mountains, animals, and the sky — all of which work together to support life. Nature gives us fresh air to breathe, food to eat, and water to drink. It teaches us peace, balance, and the importance of living in harmony. However, with growing pollution and deforestation, nature is under threat. It is our duty to protect and respect nature, so future generations can enjoy its beauty and benefits just like we do today.</p>

      <h2>Nature – Our Lifeline</h2>
      <p> Nature is the foundation of all life on Earth. It includes everything that exists naturally in the world — the trees, plants, animals, rivers, oceans, mountains, sky, sun, moon, and even the air we breathe. Nature provides us with everything we need to live — food, water, air, and shelter. The greenery of forests, the music of birds, the colors of flowers, and the calmness of rivers make the world a beautiful and peaceful place.</p>

     <h1>How to Save Nature</h1>
<p>
Saving nature is our responsibility to ensure a healthy planet for current and future generations. We can start by planting trees, keeping our surroundings clean, and reducing the use of plastic. Conserving water and electricity helps reduce pollution and protect resources. Using bicycles or public transport instead of private vehicles lowers air pollution. Avoiding litter, recycling materials, and growing plants at home are simple yet powerful actions. Protecting animals and spreading awareness about the environment also plays a big role. Small steps taken by each of us can create a big impact in saving nature and preserving its beauty and balance.
